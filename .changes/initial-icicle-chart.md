We have pulled out the planning into a new route separate from the cash flow analysis. The planning page will help someone build up something that could serve as a budget, but with more granularity and time elements related to it. It is currently a snapshot of today, but we can expand it to multiple snapshots that lead into the future. Building up and refining leads one into the cash flow analysis more gradually rather than dumping someone into what is likely considered more advanced concepts.
