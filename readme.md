## Usage
Most apps track your historical information and help you set up a budget. Argueably, budgets don't work for everyone. Even if you maintain a budget, it is still of great value to look to the future. The first version focuses on the near future checking that the inflows and outflows in your accounts are satisfactory. Essentially, will my accounts stay above zero with the planned expenditures. Tied into that, we need to understand a deal with variable debt payments (see credit cards) as future flows are more involved then a simple monthly payment you might see with a mortgage or a student loan payment. The next step from this is returning information regarding these flows such as a daily income and daily expenses. This type of information can be built upon going forward to forecast considerations like FI(RE).

## Help Out
We are working on a big styling update to move to from bulma to a css-in-js solution. This is happening on the `css-in-js` branch. All code PRs (Pull Request aka code changes) should target the `next` branch unless it is contributing to or greatly affected by the switch to `css-in-js`. After that work is complete, `css-in-js` will be merged into `next` and eventually `next` into `master` when everything on [Stable Release](https://github.com/jbolda/finatr/projects/1) is complete.

See the [Stable Release](https://github.com/jbolda/finatr/projects/1) project to track progress or find place to begin helping out. Have something you want to request or help out with that isn't on the list? Feel free to open up a new issue to open the discussion.
